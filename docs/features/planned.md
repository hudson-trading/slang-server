# Planned Features

### Goto references

This will start out with top level symbols like macros, modules, packages, and interfaces, then work it's way into scope members

### Semantic Token Highlighting

This will provide additional coloring for variable names, distinguisihing between wires, registers, and parameters.

For classes/functions it will distinguish betweeen instance variables, function args and locals.

### Inlay Hints

**Ports** - Show the type of ports in instances

**Params** - Show the resolved value of parameters

**Signals** - Show the resolved type of wires and registers, and show the value when a waveform is connected

**Macros/Functions** - Show the positional argument names

**Wildcard Ports** - Show which signals are passed through

**Wildcard Imports** - Show which symbols are imported

### Formatter

This one is pretty self explanatory.
