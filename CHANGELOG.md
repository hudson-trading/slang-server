# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

(Major, Minor) versions between clients and server need to be kept in sync. Clients require a server with the same or greater major and minor version in order to get the full feature set. Patches published for either are independent.

Vscode versions are specified version in `clients/vscode/package.json`.
Server versions are specified via git tags, with the major and minor versions following the version in the package.json.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
