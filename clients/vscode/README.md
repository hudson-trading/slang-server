# Slang Server: SystemVerilog Language Server

## Quick Start

On installation, the extension will ask if you would like it to auto-install the server from the [releases](https://github.com/hudson-trading/slang-server/releases) page.

Alternatively, you can
[build from source](https://hudson-trading.github.io/slang-server/start/building/) and set `slang.path` to your binary in your `settings.json`.

See [the docs](https://hudson-trading.github.io/slang-server) for more detailed instructions on [installing](https://hudson-trading.github.io/slang-server/start/installing/) and [configuring](https://hudson-trading.github.io/slang-server/start/config/).

## Features

Quick, high quality lint messages on from [Slang](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang) on every keystroke, with links to the [Slang warning reference](https://sv-lang.com/warning-ref.html).
